# What is Cobra?

[Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) is a commandline interface development toolkit for
Golang. It allows enables Golang developers to build robust and complex
commandline interfaces easily.

It gives developers a framework to be able to build interfaces that need more
than just the ability to parse a series of flags and arguments on a single
command. It gives developers the ability to build **subcommands**, each with
their own behaviors, flags, arguments, expectations, etc.
