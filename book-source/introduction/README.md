# Introduction

This is a quick reference guide on what the [spf13/cobra](cobra.dev) package is,
and how it can be used.

As a prerequisite, you'll need to be able to read [Golang](go.dev). This does
not aim to replace the Cobra documentation, but instead just act as a
cheatsheet/refrence for accomplishing basic tasks with the
[spf13/cobra](cobra.dev) library.

The first chapter is a bit more verbose as it sets the stage as to what Cobra is
and what problem it solves for developers.
