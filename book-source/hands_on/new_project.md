# Creating a new project

Let's create a new project. These instructions make no assumptions about
where you like to write your Go code, so it's a bit vague as to where you're
making these directories by design.

Create a new golang project where you like to store your projects (if you're
using gomodules), or within your `$GOPATH` (somewhere like
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/<yourusername>/`). 

```
mkdir math
```

Initialize gomodules in this path by calling either `go mod init` (if you're
within your `$GOPATH`, or `go mod init <module>` (if you're working in module
mode somewhere else on your filesystem).

Once you're in the `math` directory, run the new `cobra-cli` command with a few
flags.

```
cobra-cli init --author "<your name here>"
```
Example:

```
cobra-cli init --author "<your name here>"
```
Response
``` 
Your Cobra application is ready at
/Users/me/.go/src/github.com/opdev/cobra-primer/math
```

Take a look at your folder; you should see several new files that have been
scaffolded for you.

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── cmd
│   └── root.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── main.go 
```

Take a look at `main.go`.

```
package main

import "github.com/opdev/cobra-primer/math/cmd"

func main() {
	cmd.Execute()
}

```

Aside from some comments that I've truncated from this file for this book, the
overall content is incredibly short. 

All that's happening here is that we're importing a local package `cmd` and
running some function defined there called `Execute()`. 

At this point, your project should build and run without issue. Try a `go run .` 

```
$ go run .
A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains
examples and usage of using your application. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.
```

A small blurb of text generated by `cobra-cli` is returned while executing
the so called, `Root Command`.
