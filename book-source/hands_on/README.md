# Hands on with Cobra

At this point, we'll start to work with cobra itself, and go through a few use
cases that you might apply in you development. The examples here will be a bit
brief, but that's simply because this should serve as a _reference_, and not as
_documentation_ for how to use Cobra in your project.

The example logic that we'll use in our command may seem a bit silly; we don't
care too much about what this example command does, but rather what we can do with
cobra to achieve our end goal. Those concepts are what you will want to apply to
your projects.
